Elementary algorithmic project - Graph Traversal. 
Program solves a random labyrinth and lead random number of ants through in the most optimized way distributing them on different paths.
It's a graph traversal problem: we use the breadth-first search algorithm implemented with adjacency lists (linked list) and a custom
algorithm to distribute the ants based on their total number and paths they can use.
